# Answering business questions using SQL and R
The goal of this project is to use SQL and R to answer business questions and do some data analysis. Weâ€™ll be using a modified version of a database called Chinook, provided by Dataquest. This database contains information about a fictional digital music shop, its customers, employees, sales, etc.
